# cell_virus_duplication_simulation
**Overview**
This Python script simulates viral replication within a cell using probabilities for duplication and equal splitting. Each virus inside a cell has a chance to duplicate, and the resulting viruses are distributed between two daughter cells upon division.

**Features**
Probabilistic Virus Duplication: Each virus has a probability of duplicating before cell division.
Equal vs. Unequal Splitting: Duplicated viruses are either equally split or randomly assigned to daughter cells.
Cell Division Simulation: Each cell divides into two daughter cells, carrying inherited viral properties.
